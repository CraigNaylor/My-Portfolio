            <p>My name is Craig Naylor, I was born and raised in Harare, Zimbabwe. At the age of 21, I made the move to
                the UK, leaving everything and everyone i knew behind to create a future. I am currently woeking as a
                deputy area manager at Ocado, this position has been an incredible opportunity to grow and develop, both
                on a personl and professional level. However, after being in this position for a year and a half, I have
                also decided to explore other opportunities that provide fresh and ever changing challenges. Following
                this path has lead me toward front end web develpment, although i am very new to it and undoubtedly have
                mch to learn, I've found that i have a strong passion for it and I'm excited to see where this journey
                takes me!</p>
